# Maintaining Code Quality

Be disciplined in your code writing tasks to ensure that you are writing code for future maintainability. Following this code quality guide will help you avoid adding accidental complexity to the codebase.

## Owners of responsibility

When you encounter procedural code, shift your focus from *how* an operation is performed to *what* object, method, or function is responsible for doing it.

- A class is useful when there is durable state, a lifecycle, caching, or an API that benefits from grouping related operations.
- A module is enough when the responsibility needs private helpers but no per-instance state.
- A plain helper function is enough when the behavior is stateless, has no hidden invariants, and can be named precisely.
- Data that carries important invariants should usually be manipulated through the module or object that owns those invariants.
- Think of relationships between data and concepts as objects with their own responsibilities and capabilities.

*Lean into Object Oriented Programming (OOP).* - strongly consider the owners of responsibility for your logic, but there is no need to follow the "one class per noun" methodology.

## Use Encapsulation

Encapsulation is also known as "information hiding". The information hidden within a module usually consists of details about how to implement some mechanism which other parts of the system don't need to know about.

Encapsulate your code in two ways:

1. Your interfaces - classes, method signatures, function signatures - should reflect a simpler, more abstract view of the object's functionality and hide the details.
2. There are no dependencies on an object's, method's, or function's internal information from outside it.

In perfect code, each object is completely independent of the others: You could work in any of the objects without knowing anything about any of the other objects except their public interfaces.

## Respect Existing Architecture

Project-specific architecture guidance takes precedence over general code quality guidance. Use this document to improve design within the boundaries described by the relevant project docs.

- Read `docs/index.md` first and then the full documents relevant to the task.
- Keep Worker application code in `src/` compatible with the Cloudflare Workers runtime. Do not use native Node.js modules or filesystem access there.
- Keep app-specific behavior, request handlers, middleware, forms, error handlers, Transaction Scripts, data gateways, and collections under `src/app/` according to `src/app/README.md`.
- Keep presentation-layer behavior, domain workflows, data access, browser scripting, error handling, and tests in the layers described by their dedicated guides.
- Prefer the existing framework, collection, context, route, form, and template patterns before introducing a new architectural shape.

## Separate specialized code from general-purpose code

User interface code should be separated from general purpose domain code:

- Handlers, views, and templates in a web application
- A command line interface or terminal user interface

Low level adapters and drivers should be separated from general purpose domain code:

- Database adapters or mappings
- File system abstractions
- HTTP API clients

## Smaller modules, classes, and methods are not always better

Creating small classes, methods, and functions is NOT your goal when writing or refactoring code; making the code simpler is your goal. There are times when you should bring code together to make it simpler:

- Code that shares information; for example, both pieces of code might depend on information about a common protocol.
- They are used together: anyone using one of the pieces of code is likely to use the other as well.
- They overlap conceptually, in that there is a simple higher-level category that includes both of the pieces of code.
- It is hard to understand one of the pieces of code without looking at the other.

## Avoid thin wrapper classes

Avoid writing classes which are just thin wrappers over some data with getters and setters.

This is bad:

```javascript
class Dog {

    #color;
    #weight;
    #breeds;

    constructor(args) {
        this.#color = args.color;
        this.#weight = args.weight;
        this.#breeds = args.breeds;
    }

    get color() { return this.#color; }

    get weight() {
        return Number.parseFloat(this.#weight);
    }

    get breeds() {
        return this.#breeds.join(', ');
    }
}
```

Don't write useless getters and setters like that. When you see it, either remove them, or remove the whole class if it serves no other purpose. Just operate on the plain JavaScript object, and maybe include a JSDoc @typedef type definition for it.

This is better:

```javascript
class Dog {

    constructor(args) {
        this.color = args.color;
        this.weight = Number.parseFloat(args.weight);
        this.breeds = args.breeds.join(', ');
    }
}
```

Or use a type definition:

```javascript
/**
 * @typedef
 * @property {string} color - The common color of the dog
 * @property {number} weight - The weight of the dog expressed as a float
 * @property {string} breeds - The common breeds of the dog expressed as a comma separated list
 */

/**
 * @returns {Dog}
 */
function createDog(args) {
    return {
        color: args.color,
        weight: Number.parseFloat(args.weight),
        breeds: args.breeds.join(', '),
    };
}
```

## Minimize the number of arguments for methods and functions

Use the fewest number of arguments to a method or function as possible. More than three arguments should be avoided if possible. When a method seems to need more than two or three arguments, it is likely that some of those arguments could become a plain options, configuration, or specification object.

## The Linter is Authoritative

The ESLint config in `eslint.config.js` enforces the code style rules beyond what this guide explicitly includes. If the linter reports an error, fix it, even if it isn't covered by this document.

## Language Standard

This project uses JavaScript in the **ECMAScript 2022** standard using **ES modules** (no CommonJS, no `"use strict"`).

The JavaScript code in `app/` must run on multiple platforms:

- Node.js
- Deno
- Cloudflare Workers
- AWS Lambda

Therefore, it is critically important that the code in `app/` is cross platform, using modern Web Platform APIs. Never use Node, Deno, Cloudflare Worker, or AWS Lambda specific APIs for the JavaScript code in `app/`.

## Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case (`user-service.js`, not `UserService.js`)
- **Functions**: camelCase, verb-first (`createUser`, `validateToken`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase with descriptive suffixes (`UserCreateInput`, `AuthResponse`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **Boolean variables**: is/has/can prefix (`isActive`, `hasPermission`)
- **Form Data Values**: snake_case (`email_address`, `user_id`), values used in template context

## Arrow Functions

Single-expression bodies go on one line:

```javascript
[1, 2, 3].map(n => n * 10);
```

Multi-statement or complex bodies use a block on multiple lines:

```javascript
const isConst = variable.defs.some((def) => {
    return def.type === 'Variable' &&
        def.parent &&
        def.parent.kind === 'const';
});
```

## One Statement Per Line (`max-statements-per-line`)

Never put two statements on the same line. The most common mistake is a block-body arrow function on one line:

```javascript
// Wrong
const fn = () => { doSomething(); };

// Right
const fn = () => doSomething();

// Right (multi-statement block must be multiline)
const fn = () => {
    doSomething();
    doSomethingElse();
};
```

## Function Argument Objects

Destructure object arguments inside the function body, not in the parameter list. This keeps defaults and `args ?? {}` handling consistent:

```javascript
// Correct
function runSubProcess(args) {
    const {
        argv = [],
        cwd = process.cwd(),
        stderr = process.stderr,
    } = args ?? {};
}

// Wrong
function runSubProcess({ argv = [], cwd = process.cwd() } = {}) { ... }
```

## Trailing Commas (`comma-dangle`)

Multiline arrays, objects, function parameters, imports, and exports require a trailing comma after the last item. Single-line constructs must not have one:

```javascript
// Correct
const config = {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3000,
};

const result = someFunction(
    firstArgument,
    secondArgument,
);
```

## Unused Variables (`no-unused-vars`)

Every declared variable, import, and function argument must be used. If a positional argument is required by a callback signature but not needed, prefix it with `_`:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', (_event) => {
    submitForm();
});
```

The `_` prefix works for variables, function arguments, and destructured array elements. It does **not** work for caught error bindings or unused object destructuring keys. Remove unused object keys entirely.

For `catch` blocks where the error object is not needed, omit the binding entirely:

```javascript
try {
    parse(input);
} catch {
    return null;
}
```

## Private Class Members

Use ES2022 `#` private fields and methods instead of underscore prefixes:

```javascript
// Correct
class Foo {
    #privateField;
    #privateMethod() { ... }
}

// Wrong
class Foo {
    _privateField;
    _privateMethod() { ... }
}
```

## `no-undef` and Web Platform Globals

The target platforms for this web application expose Web platform APIs (`URL`, `Response`, `ReadableStream`, `structuredClone`, etc.) as globals. If a file uses one of these and the linter reports `no-undef`, add the global to the `languageOptions.globals` block in `eslint.config.js`. Do not qualify it with `globalThis`:

```javascript
// eslint.config.js
languageOptions: {
    globals: {
        URL: 'readonly',
        structuredClone: 'readonly',
    },
},
```

## Additional Lint Rules Enforced by `eslint.config.js`

Always trust the linter output. If it reports an error, fix it even if it is not explicitly documented here. Key rules to be aware of:

- `indent`: 4 spaces, `SwitchCase: 1`
- `semi`: always required
- `eol-last`: files must end with a newline
- `no-trailing-spaces`: no trailing whitespace
- `no-var`: use `const`/`let`
- `prefer-const`: use `const` when the variable is never reassigned
- `eqeqeq`: always use `===`
- `no-console`: console calls are errors (suppress with `eslint-disable-line` if intentional)
- `func-style`: use function declarations or arrow functions (no `const fn = function() {}`)
- `no-else-return`: remove `else` after a `return`
- `no-nested-ternary`: flatten nested ternaries
- `no-plusplus`: use `+= 1` instead of `++`
- `prefer-arrow-callback`: use arrow functions for callbacks, not named `function` expressions

## Type Detection

In server-side or tooling code, use the Kixx assertion helpers instead of raw `typeof`. Import assertion helpers from `kixx/assertions/mod.js` using the correct relative path from the file you are editing.

```javascript
import { isUndefined, isString } from '../../kixx/assertions/mod.js';

// Correct
if (isUndefined(value)) { ... }
if (isString(value)) { ... }

// Wrong
if (typeof value === 'undefined') { ... }
if (typeof value === 'string') { ... }
```

Choose the relative import path from the file you are editing. Do not add a new helper unless the existing assertion module lacks the needed predicate.

### Type Predicates

- `isString(value)`: String primitive or String object
- `isNonEmptyString(value)`: non-empty String
- `isNumber(value)`: Number or BigInt, including boxed values
- `isNumberNotNaN(value)`: Number/BigInt and not NaN
- `isBoolean(value)`: Boolean primitive or Boolean object
- `isUndefined(value)`: undefined
- `isPrimitive(value)`: null, undefined, String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, or Symbol
- `isFunction(value)`: any callable function/method/class constructor
- `isObjectNotNull(value)`: object and not null
- `isPlainObject(value)`: plain object or null-prototype object
- `isDate(value)`: Date instance, valid or invalid
- `isValidDate(value)`: Date with a non-NaN timestamp
- `isRegExp(value)`: RegExp instance
- `isMap(value)`: Map or WeakMap
- `isSet(value)`: Set or WeakSet

### Comparison and Formatting

- `isEqual(a, b)`: strict equality plus valid-Date equality and NaN === NaN; curryable
- `doesMatch(matcher, value)`: RegExp.test(), isEqual(), String.includes(), or ISO date matching; curryable
- `toFriendlyString(value)`: human-readable value formatter for diagnostics

## Async Code

Rule: When an async function or method delegates its return value to another Promise-returning operation, await that operation before returning. Do not return the delegated Promise directly.

Awaiting the Promise causes a rejection to pass through the current function, preserving that function as an async frame in the error stack. Accordingly, Promise-forwarding wrappers should generally be declared `async` and use `return await`.

This is correct:

```js
import { renderHtmlErrorPage } from '../lib/html-error-page.js';

export async function siteErrorHandler(context, request, response, error) {
    return await renderHtmlErrorPage(context, request, response, error, '/errors', 'Kixx');
}
```

This is incorrect because `siteErrorHandler()` may be omitted from the error stack if the delegated Promise rejects:

```js
import { renderHtmlErrorPage } from '../lib/html-error-page.js';

export async function siteErrorHandler(context, request, response, error) {
    return renderHtmlErrorPage(context, request, response, error, '/errors', 'Kixx');
}
```

## Inline Code Comments

Use inline comments to explain intent, constraints, context, and decisions that the code cannot express clearly by itself. Be opportunistic: when you had to reason about why code belongs in its current shape, leave a short comment so the next reader does not have to rediscover that reasoning.

Focus on why the code exists and why it does what it does, especially when it seems counterintuitive or requires domain knowledge:

```javascript
// Increment DB counter before processing to avoid getting stuck on
// the same database if the current run hits the time limit.
currentDb = (currentDb + 1) % totalDatabases;
```

Good inline comments often capture:

- why this branch exists
- why this order matters
- why this default is safe or required
- why a value is cloned, frozen, normalized, or rewrapped
- why an error is caught, translated, hidden, or allowed to propagate
- why a simpler-looking implementation would be wrong in this runtime

Prefer one or two focused lines near the decision. A useful comment does not need to justify the whole function.

### Avoid Trivial Comments

Bad:

```javascript
user.name = 'John'; // Set the user name to John
```

Good:

```javascript
user.name = sanitizeInput(rawName); // Remove potential XSS vectors
```

Even when the code is readable inline comments can be useful. Readable code shows what happens; but a good comment preserves context that is not present in the syntax, tests, or local variable names.

### Comment While the Context Is Fresh

When adding or changing code, add inline comments at the same time you make the decision. This is especially important when the code depends on framework contracts, platform limits, HTTP semantics, request lifecycle timing, storage consistency, security posture, or compatibility with existing callers.

```javascript
// Clone before storing so later caller-side mutation cannot change request
// routing state after middleware has started.
this.#routes = routes.slice();
```

### Use Guide Comments to Break Up Complex Logic

Use short guide comments to separate phases in longer logic when the section boundaries help readers scan intent.

```javascript
async function processPayment(order, paymentMethod) {
    // Validate payment details and customer eligibility.
    await validatePaymentMethod(paymentMethod);
    await checkCustomerCredit(order.customerId);

    // Calculate final amounts including taxes and fees.
    const taxAmount = calculateTax(order);
    const finalAmount = order.total + taxAmount + calculateFee(paymentMethod, order.total);

    // Process payment and update order status.
    const transaction = await chargePayment(paymentMethod, finalAmount);
    await updateOrderStatus(order.id, 'paid', transaction.id);

    return transaction;
}
```

### Document State Transitions and Side Effects

```javascript
// After this call, the connection state changes to 'authenticating'
// and subsequent messages are queued until auth completes.
await connection.startAuthentication(credentials);
```

### Use Teacher Comments for Domain Knowledge

```javascript
// JWT exp claim uses NumericDate format in seconds since epoch.
// JavaScript Date.now() returns milliseconds, so divide by 1000.
const expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60 * 24);
```

### Document Workarounds and Hacks

```javascript
// Workaround: Some legacy clients send timestamps as strings.
// TODO: Remove this once all clients upgrade to v2.
const timestamp = typeof data.timestamp === 'string'
    ? parseInt(data.timestamp, 10)
    : data.timestamp;
```

### Explain Performance or Memory Considerations

```javascript
// Pre-allocate the buffer to avoid repeated reallocations during
// high-frequency writes.
const buffer = Buffer.allocUnsafe(expectedSize);

// Process in chunks to avoid blocking the event loop.
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += CHUNK_SIZE) {
    const chunk = items.slice(i, i + CHUNK_SIZE);
    await processChunk(chunk);

    // Yield control back to the event loop between chunks.
    await setImmediate();
}
```

### Explain Protocol, Security, and Compatibility Decisions

Use inline comments for decisions that encode HTTP rules, browser behavior, platform limits, security posture, or compatibility with external clients. These comments should explain the consequence, not just restate the operation.

```javascript
// Content-Length is measured in bytes, not JavaScript characters; using
// string length can truncate UTF-8 responses containing multi-byte characters.
const contentLength = new Blob([ body ]).size;
```

### Flag Coordinated Change Points

```javascript
const EVENT_TYPES = {
    USER_LOGIN: 'user:login',
    USER_LOGOUT: 'user:logout',
    // WARNING: When adding event types here, also update:
    // - src/analytics/event-handlers.js
    // - test/fixtures/events.json
};
```
