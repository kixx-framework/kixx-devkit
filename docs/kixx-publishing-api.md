# Publishing API v1

The Publishing API publishes and rolls back a website's content: static
assets, templates, page metadata, and email content.

The API is mounted at:

```text
/publishing-api/v1
```

Examples in this document use `http://localhost:2026`, the default development
server origin.

## The atomic release model

Read this section before using any endpoint below. Misunderstanding it leads
to misusing every endpoint that follows.

**A release of server-side code and a release of website content ship as one
atomic unit.** This is the guarantee the entire API is built to uphold, and
every endpoint below exists in service of it. A build's code and the content
it renders are never allowed to drift apart: you cannot end up running code
authored for one site version against content authored for another.

The mechanism is the `BUILD_ID` environment variable. `BUILD_ID` identifies
one build of the server source (Node.js process or Cloudflare Worker), and a
**build pointer** records which content **Release** that build serves.
Deploying code and switching content are therefore **the same act**: setting
`BUILD_ID` to a value already pointed at the Release you intend to serve.
**There is no separate "activate" step and no atomic switch to engineer** —
a Worker deploy and a process restart are already atomic, so setting (or
reverting) `BUILD_ID` reverts the code and the content it was authored
against as a single, indivisible coordinate. The
[Code-plus-content release (pre-staging)](#2-code-plus-content-release-pre-staging)
workflow below is how a publishing client puts this to use for an atomic
deploy.

Three objects make this work:

| Concept | Identity | Mutable | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Object | content hash | no | Immutable bytes: one file's content, addressed by its hash. No pathname, no kind, no build. |
| Release | closure root hash | no | One complete, fully verified website version — every object it names is guaranteed to exist and be servable. |
| Build pointer | operator-chosen `buildId` | yes | Which Release a given server build serves. |

Because a Release carries no build association, publishing forward,
rolling back, and carrying code-only content forward are all the **same
operation** — assigning an existing Release to a build id — differing only
in which build id and which Release:

- **Content-only publish**: create a Release, assign it to the build that is
  already running.
- **Code-plus-content release**: create a Release, assign it to the build id
  that CI will deploy *next* — before that build exists — then deploy the
  code. This is pre-staging: a publishing client chooses the `BUILD_ID` a
  future deploy will use, uploads and verifies content against it first, and
  only then triggers the deploy. The deploy is the activation.
- **Code-only deploy**: assign the *same* Release the running build already
  serves to the next build id. No manifest, no re-upload — just a pointer
  write.
- **Rollback**: assign an earlier Release back to a build id.

## Endpoint summary

| Method | Path | Required permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | Authenticated (no additional grant) | Discovery: contract version, running build id, addressing format, limits |
| `POST` | `/objects/status` | `urn:kixx:create` on `urn:kixx:publishing:objects` | Which of these object ids does the store hold |
| `PUT` | `/objects/:objectId` | `urn:kixx:create` on `urn:kixx:publishing:objects` | Upload one immutable object |
| `POST` | `/releases` | `urn:kixx:create` on `urn:kixx:publishing:releases` | Create and fully verify a Release |
| `POST` | `/releases/validation` | `urn:kixx:create` on `urn:kixx:publishing:releases` | Verify a Release without persisting it |
| `GET` | `/releases` | `urn:kixx:get` on `urn:kixx:publishing:releases` | Release history |
| `GET` | `/releases/:releaseId` | `urn:kixx:get` on `urn:kixx:publishing:releases` | Release metadata |
| `GET` | `/releases/:releaseId/manifest` | `urn:kixx:get` on `urn:kixx:publishing:releases` | Complete manifest, for whole-site diffing |
| `GET` | `/builds` | `urn:kixx:get` on `urn:kixx:publishing:builds` | Every registered build pointer |
| `GET` | `/builds/:buildId` | `urn:kixx:get` on `urn:kixx:publishing:builds` | One build pointer, running or not |
| `PUT` | `/builds/:buildId` | `urn:kixx:update` on `urn:kixx:publishing:builds` | Assign a Release to that build |
| `GET` | `/builds/:buildId/activations` | `urn:kixx:get` on `urn:kixx:publishing:builds` | Activation history for that build |

Only the methods shown are allowed on a recognized path. A different method
returns `405 Method Not Allowed` with an `Allow` header.

## Authentication and authorization

Every request, including discovery, requires a Publishing API bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <publishing-token>
```

Create a token through the [Admin API](admin-api.md#create-a-publishing-api-token).
Missing, malformed, or unknown bearer credentials return `401` with code
`UNAUTHENTICATED_ERROR`. Expired and revoked tokens return `403` with code
`PublishingApiTokenInactive`.

Permissions are derived from the token's stored roles for every request. The
`editor` role (and `root-admin`, `developer`, `admin`) can `get` and `create`
across every publishing resource, and can additionally `update`
`urn:kixx:publishing:builds` — the one resource a publishing-capable role may
mutate rather than only create, because assigning a build pointer moves an
existing, already-published Release and can never create new content. An
authenticated token without the required grant receives `403 FORBIDDEN_ERROR`.

Authentication and authorization occur before an endpoint reads or validates
a request body.

Creating an object consumes storage nothing can currently reclaim — the
content store has no delete operation — so object upload permission is worth
granting deliberately. Object uploads check the declared `Content-Length`
against 25 MiB; status requests are capped at 100 ids.

## Protocol conventions

### JSON:API documents

All successful responses are JSON:API documents with:

```http
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json; charset=utf-8
```

Every JSON write endpoint (`POST /objects/status`, `POST /releases`,
`POST /releases/validation`, `PUT /builds/:buildId`) requires:

```http
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

Media-type parameters such as `charset=utf-8` are accepted. A missing or
different media type returns `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

Those endpoints accept one resource document:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "ResourceType",
        "attributes": {}
    }
}
```

`data` and `data.attributes` must be objects, and `data.type` must be a
non-empty string. A malformed document returns `400 Bad Request`; an
incorrect resource type returns `409 Conflict` with code
`JsonApiResourceTypeMismatch`.

`PUT /objects/:objectId` is the one exception: its body is raw, non-empty
bytes with no envelope and no required media type, exactly like
static-asset uploads elsewhere in this project.

### Error documents

Expected errors use JSON:API error documents. Error `status` values are
strings; a validation failure can carry more than one error object, each with
a JSON-pointer-style `source`:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "status": "422",
            "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
            "title": "ValidationError",
            "detail": "Object \"<hash>\" is missing",
            "source": "/pages/about/template"
        }
    ]
}
```

Error codes used by this API:

| Status | Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | `BAD_REQUEST_ERROR` | Malformed JSON:API request or bad pagination |
| `401` | `UNAUTHENTICATED_ERROR` | Bearer credentials are absent, malformed, or unknown |
| `403` | `FORBIDDEN_ERROR` | The token lacks the endpoint permission |
| `403` | `PublishingApiTokenInactive` | The token is expired or revoked |
| `404` | `ReleaseNotFound` | No such Release |
| `404` | `BuildNotFound` | No such build pointer |
| `405` | `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED_ERROR` | The method is not allowed on the recognized path |
| `409` | `JsonApiResourceTypeMismatch` | Request resource type is wrong |
| `409` | `ObjectSizeMismatch` | A stored object's size disagrees with the manifest |
| `411` | `LengthRequired` | An object upload omitted `Content-Length` |
| `412` | `BuildPointerConflict` | The pointer precondition no longer holds |
| `413` | `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE_ERROR` | An object upload's declared `Content-Length` exceeds `maxObjectBytes` |
| `415` | `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE_ERROR` | The request media type is not accepted |
| `422` | `ObjectIdMismatch` | Uploaded bytes do not match the object id in the URL |
| `422` | `ObjectIdInvalid` | An object id is not a valid content address |
| `422` | `MissingContentObjects` | The manifest names objects the store does not hold |
| `422` | `InvalidReleaseManifest` | The manifest structure or content is invalid |
| `422` | `InvalidBuildAssignment` | `data.id`, `attributes.releaseId`, `attributes.expectedAssignmentId`, or `attributes.reason` fails validation |
| `428` | `PreconditionRequired` | A build pointer write omitted JSON `attributes.expectedAssignmentId` |

Unexpected storage failures are not part of the public contract and are
reported as server failures without exposing internal details.

## Discovery

```http
GET /publishing-api/v1/
```

Requires a valid bearer token but no specific permission grant. Reports the running deploy's own build id,
the content contract version this code supports, the object-addressing
format, and every enforced limit, so a client can adapt before making a
mistake a later request would reject.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "PublishingApi",
        "id": "v1",
        "attributes": {
            "runningBuildId": "production",
            "contentContractVersion": 1,
            "addressingFormat": 4,
            "buildAssignmentProtocolVersion": 2,
            "limits": {
                "maxObjectBytes": 26214400,
                "maxObjectStatusIds": 100,
                "maxManifestEntries": 10000
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`runningBuildId` is `null` when the deploy has no runtime build id
configured at all — a configuration state distinct from a build id that has
never been assigned a Release, which `GET /builds/:buildId` reports as `404`.

`buildAssignmentProtocolVersion: 2` requires JSON assignment tokens. Its absence
identifies the legacy protocol; clients must negotiate before writing. This
version is separate from `contentContractVersion`, which describes Release
compatibility. Protocol 2 has no hash or conditional-header write fallback.

## Check which objects are already stored

```http
POST /publishing-api/v1/objects/status
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "ObjectStatus",
        "attributes": {
            "objectIds": [ "<object-id-1>", "<object-id-2>" ]
        }
    }
}
```

`attributes.objectIds` is deduplicated by the server and capped at
`maxObjectStatusIds` (100) unique ids. The response lists only the ids that
are actually stored, as a set with no promised order — an id absent from the
response is not stored:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "type": "Object",
            "id": "<object-id-1>",
            "attributes": { "size": 1234 }
        }
    ]
}
```

Use this before uploading a local content tree, to send bytes only for
objects the store does not already have.

## Upload an object

```http
PUT /publishing-api/v1/objects/:objectId
```

Send raw, non-empty bytes as the body, with no JSON:API envelope. The server
recomputes the content address from the received bytes and compares it with
`:objectId` in the URL:

```bash
curl --request PUT \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer kxpat_<secret>' \
    --data-binary '@site.css' \
    http://localhost:2026/publishing-api/v1/objects/<object-id>
```

A declared `Content-Length` over `maxObjectBytes` (25 MiB) returns
`413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE_ERROR` before the body is read. The server trusts this
header and does not count incoming bytes against the limit. A missing header
returns `411 LengthRequired` before the body is read.
A content-address mismatch returns `422 ObjectIdMismatch` and
stores nothing. On success the response distinguishes a newly stored object
(`201 Created`) from one that was already present (`200 OK`), so a client
can report how many bytes it actually transferred:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "Object",
        "id": "<object-id>",
        "attributes": { "size": 1234 }
    }
}
```

Uploading works even when no build anywhere has ever been assigned a
Release — the object endpoints never resolve a build pointer, which is what
makes bootstrapping a brand-new site possible.

## Create a Release

```http
POST /publishing-api/v1/releases
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "Release",
        "attributes": {
            "manifest": {
                "staticAssets": {
                    "css/site.css": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 1234 }
                },
                "globalTemplatePartials": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 98 },
                "baseTemplates": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 210 },
                "pages": {
                    "about": {
                        "metadata": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 41 },
                        "partials": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 62 },
                        "includes": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 19 },
                        "templates": {
                            "page.html": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 28 }
                        }
                    }
                },
                "emails": {
                    "welcome": { "objectId": "<object-id>", "size": 300 }
                }
            },
            "provenance": {
                "sourceRevision": "a1b2c3d",
                "message": "Publish the About page",
                "intendedForBuildId": "build-142"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The manifest is a **complete replacement**: an omitted facet is absent from
the Release, and never inherits from whatever is currently live.
`staticAssets`, `pages`, and `emails` are keyed by canonical logical
pathnames — lowercase-insensitive is not applied; a non-canonical pathname is
rejected outright rather than normalized. Each reference is
`{ objectId, size }`; static-asset references may add an optional
`mediaType`. `pages.<path>.templates` is a filename-to-reference map, letting
one page publish more than one template.

`attributes.provenance` is optional, immutable, non-binding metadata:
`sourceRevision`, `message`, `client`, and `intendedForBuildId` (the build id
this Release was authored for — a hint for pre-staging audits, not a binding
constraint; nothing prevents assigning a Release to a different build id).

Creation runs, and fails before persisting anything if any step fails:

1. manifest schema validation;
2. object existence and size verification against every referenced object id;
3. JSON parsing and schema validation for structured payloads (template
   bundles, page metadata, email bundles, includes).

Template source is not compiled and partial references are not resolved during
release validation or creation. Successful release validation does not
guarantee successful rendering.

A manifest naming an object the store does not hold fails with
`422 MissingContentObjects`, listing every missing reference — not just the
first — up to a documented cap. A claimed size that disagrees with the
stored size fails with `409 ObjectSizeMismatch`. Malformed JSON or a structured
payload that violates its schema fails with
`422 InvalidReleaseManifest`. Metadata and email context data must be JSON
objects; their nested values are not recursively validated.

The response is `201 Created`:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "Release",
        "id": "<release-id>",
        "attributes": {
            "createdAt": "2026-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",
            "createdBy": "<publishing-token-id>",
            "objectCount": 6,
            "totalBytes": 1972,
            "contractVersion": 1,
            "provenance": {
                "sourceRevision": "a1b2c3d",
                "message": "Publish the About page",
                "intendedForBuildId": "build-142"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`id` is the Release's closure root hash, so re-creating byte-identical
content returns the **original** Release record unchanged — creation is
content-idempotent, and there are no idempotency keys anywhere in this API.
Creating a Release never assigns it to any build; see
[Assign a Release to a build](#assign-a-release-to-a-build) below.

## Verify a Release without publishing it

```http
POST /publishing-api/v1/releases/validation
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

Same request body as `POST /releases`, same verification pipeline, but nothing
is persisted on success or failure — no
objects, no closure, no Release record. Use this to gate a CI build without
creating an unreferenced closure for every candidate commit.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "ReleaseValidation",
        "id": "<release-id>",
        "attributes": {
            "objectCount": 6,
            "totalBytes": 1972,
            "contractVersion": 1
        }
    }
}
```

## Release history

```http
GET /publishing-api/v1/releases?limit=25&cursor=<cursor>
```

Lists Releases newest first with stable cursor pagination. `limit` is
optional (1 through 100); `cursor` continues a prior page.

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "type": "Release",
            "id": "<release-id>",
            "attributes": {
                "createdAt": "2026-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",
                "createdBy": "<publishing-token-id>",
                "objectCount": 6,
                "totalBytes": 1972,
                "contractVersion": 1,
                "provenance": {}
            }
        }
    ],
    "meta": { "cursor": "<next-cursor-or-null>" }
}
```

```http
GET /publishing-api/v1/releases/:releaseId
```

Gets one Release's metadata. Returns `404 ReleaseNotFound` when no such
Release was ever created.

```http
GET /publishing-api/v1/releases/:releaseId/manifest
```

Gets the complete manifest stored inside the Release's immutable closure —
every reference it names, exactly as validated. Use this for whole-site
diffing against a local content tree, without walking per-pathname
endpoints. Returns `404 ReleaseNotFound` when the Release closure is absent.

## Build pointers

```http
GET /publishing-api/v1/builds
```

Lists every registered build pointer, newest assignment first:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "type": "Build",
            "id": "production",
            "attributes": {
                "releaseId": "<release-id>",
                "assignedAt": "2026-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",
                "assignmentId": "<assignment-id>"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This is what surfaces a phantom or orphaned build id — it appears here even
though nothing is running it yet.

```http
GET /publishing-api/v1/builds/:buildId
```

Gets one build's authoritative pointer, whether or not that build is
currently running. Returns `404 BuildNotFound` when the build has never been
assigned. Copy `attributes.assignmentId` verbatim into the next write's JSON
precondition. Every changed assignment gets a new UUID, even when returning to
a previously assigned Release. The assignment identity appears only in the
response body; Build responses carry no `ETag` and no validator of any kind:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "Build",
        "id": "production",
        "attributes": {
            "releaseId": "<release-id>",
            "assignedAt": "2026-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",
            "assignmentId": "<assignment-id>"
        }
    }
}
```

This is the endpoint that makes pre-staging verifiable: read back what was
just staged for a build id nothing is running yet, before triggering the
deploy that will run it.

### Assign a Release to a build

```http
PUT /publishing-api/v1/builds/:buildId
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "Build",
        "id": "production",
        "attributes": {
            "releaseId": "<release-id>",
            "expectedAssignmentId": "<observed-assignment-id>",
            "reason": "publish"
        }
    }
}
```

`data.id` must equal the route `:buildId`, and `attributes.releaseId` must be
a syntactically valid content address; either failing, or an unrecognized
`attributes.reason`, returns `422 InvalidBuildAssignment`. A well-formed
`releaseId` that names a Release that was never created returns
`404 ReleaseNotFound`. `attributes.reason` is optional audit metadata
(`publish`, default; `rollback`; `carry-forward`; `restore`) and changes no
behavior.

**A JSON precondition is mandatory; there is no unconditional API form:**

| `attributes.expectedAssignmentId` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Observed assignment UUID | Assign only if the build still has this assignment identity |
| `null` | Assign only if the build has no current pointer |
| Omitted, including a header-only request | `428 PreconditionRequired` |
| Malformed token or type | `422 InvalidBuildAssignment` with a field error |
| Valid token or null plus `If-Match` or `If-None-Match` | `400 BAD_REQUEST_ERROR`; write preconditions belong in JSON |
| Stale UUID, or null when already assigned | `412 BuildPointerConflict`, even for the currently assigned Release |

A valid request naming a missing Release returns `404 ReleaseNotFound` before
checking for a stale identity.

Assigning the current Release is a success no-op only after its precondition
passes. It preserves `assignedAt` and `assignmentId` and adds no Activation.
A→B→A creates three distinct identities, so the first A token remains stale.

The response is `200 OK` with the resulting Build resource, carrying the
assignment identity the next write must quote. Build JSON contains only
`releaseId`, `assignedAt`, and `assignmentId` attributes. Every Publishing API
response is authenticated, so all of them are `private, no-store`.

If a client loses a response after a successful assignment, it must read and
reconcile the current Build before deciding what to do. Retrying the same
conditional request may return `412` because the identity has already changed.
There is no unconditional retry or request-idempotency mechanism.

## Build activation history

```http
GET /publishing-api/v1/builds/:buildId/activations?limit=25&cursor=<cursor>
```

Lists every changed assignment to one build, newest first. A successful
same-target no-op creates no entry. Returns
`404 BuildNotFound` when the build has never been assigned.

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "type": "Activation",
            "id": "production:<assignment-id>",
            "attributes": {
                "buildId": "production",
                "assignmentId": "<assignment-id>",
                "fromReleaseId": "<previous-release-id>",
                "toReleaseId": "<release-id>",
                "activatedAt": "2026-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",
                "activatedBy": "<publishing-token-id>",
                "reason": "publish"
            }
        }
    ],
    "meta": { "cursor": "<next-cursor-or-null>" }
}
```

Together with `GET /releases`, this is enough to plan and execute a rollback
using no root hash the client happened to keep from an earlier publish.

Each entry carries the `assignmentId` of the assignment it records, and its
`id` is derived from `<buildId>:<assignmentId>`. One committed assignment
therefore has exactly one history entry: appending the same assignment twice
rewrites that one entry rather than adding a duplicate.

Activation history is best-effort. The build pointer commits first, then the
server makes one attempt to append the Activation. A crash, timeout, or storage
failure between those two steps can leave an assignment with no history entry,
and that gap is permanent today: nothing retries the append and no repair
command exists. Treat the history as an informational record, not an audit
guarantee. The append is idempotent, so a retry or repair path may be added
later without risking duplicate entries.

The pointer, not the history, is authoritative. A missing entry never blocks
the next publish: read `GET /builds/:buildId` and use its `assignmentId`.

## Workflows

### 1. Content-only publish

Publish a change to the site the running build already serves.

1. `POST /objects/status` with local content hashes; upload only the ones
   missing with `PUT /objects/:objectId`.
2. `POST /releases` with the complete manifest.
3. `GET /builds/:buildId` for the running build to retrieve its current
   JSON `assignmentId`.
4. `PUT /builds/:buildId` with the new `releaseId` and JSON
   `expectedAssignmentId: "<observed-assignment-id>"`.

### 2. Code-plus-content release (pre-staging)

Ship server code and content as one atomic unit.

1. Choose the `BUILD_ID` the next CI deploy will use — call it `next`.
2. Upload objects and `POST /releases` as above, against the running build's
   code (or a scratch client that only needs the object and Release
   endpoints — neither touches any build pointer).
3. `PUT /builds/next` with `expectedAssignmentId: null` in JSON — `next` has never been
   assigned, so this is safe even under concurrent publishers racing to
   stage the same future build.
4. `GET /builds/next` to verify what was staged, before triggering anything.
5. Deploy the code with `BUILD_ID=next`. The deploy is the activation; no
   further request against this API is needed.

### 3. Code-only deploy

Ship new server code with no content change: two small requests, no
manifest.

1. `GET /builds/:runningBuildId` to read the currently served `releaseId`.
2. `PUT /builds/next` with that same `releaseId` and `expectedAssignmentId: null` in JSON.
3. Deploy the code with `BUILD_ID=next`.

### 4. Rollback

1. `GET /releases` or `GET /builds/:buildId/activations` to find the Release
   to restore — no client-retained root hash is required.
2. `GET /builds/:buildId` for its current JSON `assignmentId`.
3. `PUT /builds/:buildId` with the earlier `releaseId` and JSON
   `expectedAssignmentId: "<observed-assignment-id>"`.

Stop and investigate on `412 BuildPointerConflict` rather than retrying
blindly — it means something else moved the pointer in the meantime, and a
blind retry would silently overwrite that concurrent change.

### Bootstrap: publishing to a store with nothing assigned anywhere

No special-cased endpoint exists for first boot, because none is needed:

1. `PUT /objects/:objectId` works before any build pointer exists anywhere —
   object endpoints never resolve one.
2. `POST /releases` works the same way.
3. `PUT /builds/:buildId` with `expectedAssignmentId: null` in JSON makes the very first
   assignment for that build id, exactly like pre-staging a future build.

A build whose code is already running but has no Release assigned serves
`503` naming the build id, rather than crashing, until step 3 completes.
